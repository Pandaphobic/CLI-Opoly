# CLI-Opoly

CLI-Opoly - A terrible rendition of a classic game!

### Main Idea
An ultra light CLI version of the classic game written in typescript supporting multiplayer, chat, trading and terminal based UI. The goal is to have a working NPX command at some point so that as long as you have NPM, you can start or join a CLI-Opoly game.

### Expected Feature List
- Multiplayer
- True to original game rules
- Sexy Terminal UI
- P2P based multiplayer
- NPX run command
- Trading
- Chat
- Custom Boards
- Custom Cards
- Free Forever!
